🚀 AI-Powered Code Reviewer | MERN Stack + Generative AI

Excited to share my latest project where I built an AI-Powered Code Reviewer using the MERN Stack, designed to analyze code, provide intelligent reviews, and suggest improvements in real time.

🔹 What this project does:
Users can submit code snippets and instantly receive AI-generated feedback on code quality, best practices, and potential improvements—helping developers write cleaner and more efficient code.

🔹 Tech Stack & Features:
• MongoDB, Express.js, React (Vite), Node.js
• Google Generative AI integration for automated code review
• RESTful APIs with POST-based request handling
• PrismJS for syntax highlighting
• Markdown rendering for well-structured AI responses
• Axios & CORS for smooth frontend–backend communication
• Clean, responsive UI with improved layout and styling

🔹 What I learned:
• End-to-end AI integration in a full-stack app
• Backend API design & refactoring for scalability
• Handling AI responses and improving UX
• Building production-ready React applications

This project strengthened my understanding of full-stack development, API design, and real-world AI applications. Looking forward to building more intelligent developer tools! 💻✨
